                                <p>With more and more occupations requiring advanced education, a college degree is critical to your success in today's workforce. But earning an accredited college degree&nbsp;can also have a significant impact on other areas of your life.</p>
                                <h3>1. College graduates earn more on average.</h3>
                                <p>According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (<a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/unemployment-earnings-education.htm###"" target="_blank">BLS</a>), workers with a bachelor's degree earned an average of $468 per week than workers with only a high school diploma - a higher salary that can add up over the course of your lifetime. A 2015 report from the U.S. Department of Education found the average worker with a bachelor's degree&nbsp;may earn approximately <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/fact-sheet-focusing-higher-education-student-success" target="_blank">$1 million more</a> than a worker without a postsecondary education.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <h3>2. Workers with a college degree are less likely to face unemployment.</h3>
                                <p>In addition to the potential to make more money, earning your college degree could also lead to more career stability. According to BLS <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/unemployment-earnings-education.htm###"" target="_blank">data</a>, just 2.2% of workers with a bachelor's degree are facing unemployment, compared to 4.1% of workers with only a high school diploma.</p>
                                <h3>3. College graduates are more likely to experience job satisfaction.</h3>
                                <p>A 2016 Pew Research report found that <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/10/06/3-how-americans-view-their-jobs/" target="_blank">77% of workers with a post-graduate degree</a> and 60% of workers with a bachelor's degree believe their job gives them a sense of identity, versus just 38% of those with a high school diploma or less. Workers with a bachelor's degree or more advanced education were are also significantly more to say their job is a career, with 70% viewing their job as a career compared to just 39% of workers with no college education .</p>
                                <h3>4. A college degree can boost your financial savvy.</h3>
                                <p>Working-age adults with bachelor's degrees are <a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/files/resources/its-not-just-the-money.pdf" target="_blank">9.4 times more likely</a> to have a bank account than those with a high school diploma as their highest level of education, according to a 2016 report from the Lumina Foundation.</p>
                                <p>College-educated adults were also less likely to have used expensive forms of credit. Just 2.3% of college-educated adults used pay-day and tax refund loans within the last year, compared to 9.2% of high school graduates without a college education.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <h3>5. College degree holders are more likely to be homeowners.</h3>
                                <p>A 2016 report from real estate company Zillow found that <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/zillow-group-report-2016-13279/" target="_blank">75% of all home buyers</a> were college-educated in that year, compared to just 11% who had a high school diploma only and 14% who attended some college but did not earn a degree.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <h3>6. College graduates are more likely to be married (and for longer!)</h3>
                                <p>65% of adults ages 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or more were married in 2014, compared with 53% of adults with less education, according to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/04/education-and-marriage/">2015 Pew Research Center report</a>.</p>
                                <p>A degree could mean a longer-lasting marriage, too. According to the report, researchers at the National Center for Health Statistics estimate that 78% of college-educated women who married for the first time between 2006 and 2010 could expect their marriages to last at least 20 years, compared to just 40% of women with a high school education or less.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <h3>7. Earn a college education and you could even live a longer life.</h3>
                                <p>Just one additional year of college education can decrease your mortality rate by <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-effect-of-college-education-on-mortality/" target="_blank">15% to 19%</a>, according to a 2016 report by the Brookings Institute. In fact, high school graduates have a mortality rate that is double those with some college or a college degree, the report states.</p>
                                <h3>8. A college degree could also mean better health.</h3>
                                <p>A Lumina Foundation report found that college degree holders demonstrate <a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/files/resources/its-not-just-the-money.pdf" target="_blank">healthier habits</a> than non-degree holders.</p>
                                <p>The proportion of adults smoking daily falls significantly with an increase in education, the report states, from 20% of high school graduates without any college education to 5% of those with bachelor's degrees and just 3% of workers with graduate degrees.</p>
                                <p>The report also found a strong positive relationship between educational attainment and eating fruits and vegetables, exercising and wearing a seat belt.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <h3>9. Earning a college degree could even boost your happiness.</h3>
                                <p><a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/files/resources/its-not-just-the-money.pdf" target="_blank">94% of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher</a> reported being happy or very happy with life, compared to 89% of adults with no college education, according to the Lumina Foundation report.</p>
                                <p></p>
                                <h3>10. Earn a college degree; be a better citizen.</h3>
                                <p>Earning your college degree can improve the lives of those around you, too. According to the Lumina Foundation report, <a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/files/resources/its-not-just-the-money.pdf" target="_blank">40% of working-age adults with a bachelor's degree</a> volunteered in their community within the past year, compared to just 17% of high school graduates without any college education.</p>
